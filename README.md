# hello-world
My first repository on Github
This is my first step towards using Github as I learn programming in Python and R.  I have prior experience in other languages but my primary occupation revolves around financial modeling, investment banking and trading of financial instruments.  I have a strong interest in programming and eventually would like to use it for data science, financial modeling and analysis as an alternative to spreadsheets and to write algorithms for trading.
